# Lingering Injuries
When a player character is reduced to 0 Hit Points or less, there is a chance they will receive a lingering injury.  When the character is revived, they must make a diff 12 CON check.  On a success, no lingering injury is accrued.  On a failure, the character rolls on the lingering injury table.
