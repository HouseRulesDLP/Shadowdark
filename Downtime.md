Each type of activity (except **Extended Rest** and **Other**) grants the character a chance to earn a boon but may also incur a bane depending on the roll.

## Carousing
The character chooses to celebrate their victories (or drown their sorrows) with wine, song and (possibly) companionship.  Each participant decides how much silver they wish to spend in their celebrations; the more money spent, the more lavish the revelries.  This provides a modifier that is applied to a die roll to determine the outcome of the weekâ€™s carousing.  Roll 1d20 + your **Charisma modifier** + your **Spending Bonus** on the **Carousing Results** table.
